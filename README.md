# SQL-Server-SSMS-Database-Skills-and-Services-I-Offer

CREATE DATABASE to start a new project

DROP DATABASE to safely remove databases when needed

USE DatabaseName to switch between datasets

This is essential for organizing data into professional database environments.

📋 Table Creation and Professional Data Design

I design and build tables for systems such as:

Employees

Customers

Orders

Products

Inventory tracking

I create tables with correct column types and real-world structure.

🔧 Altering Tables and Fixing Column Data Types

I can modify tables after creation using:

ALTER TABLE to update structures

Changing column types (example: converting prices into FLOAT values)

Example skills:

Converting price/spending columns into numeric formats for calculations

Ensuring data types match business requirements

This helps prevent errors and improves performance in real projects.

🔒 Constraints and Data Validation

I apply SQL constraints to protect data quality:

PRIMARY KEY for unique row identification

FOREIGN KEY for linking tables together

UNIQUE to prevent duplicate entries

NOT NULL to require important fields

CHECK for rule enforcement (ex: age ≥ 18)

DEFAULT values for automatic data filling

This ensures clean and reliable databases.

✏️ Data Insertion, Updating, and Deletion

I manage table records using:

INSERT INTO to add new data

UPDATE to edit existing records

DELETE to remove specific rows

TRUNCATE to clear data while keeping the table

Perfect for maintaining accurate datasets.

🔍 Advanced Query Writing and Filtering

I write SQL queries to retrieve specific information using:

SELECT statements

Filters with WHERE, AND, OR, NOT

Removing duplicates with DISTINCT

This allows fast and accurate data searching.

📊 Sorting and Limiting Results

I can organize query outputs using:

ORDER BY for sorting

TOP for returning limited rows

Useful for reports and dashboards.

🔗 JOIN Operations and Relational Database Linking

I work with multiple-table relationships using:

INNER JOIN

LEFT JOIN

RIGHT JOIN

FULL OUTER JOIN

SELF JOIN

This allows combining customer, order, and product information into one result.

🔄 Combining Results with UNION

I merge results from different queries using:

UNION (removes duplicates)

UNION ALL (keeps duplicates)

Useful for multi-source reporting.

🧼 Data Cleaning and Text Formatting

I clean messy customer input using advanced string functions:

TRIM() to remove extra spaces

UPPER() to standardize coupon codes

LOWER() to normalize text for reports

LEFT() to limit customer ID length

SUBSTRING() to extract product category codes

CONCAT() to build shipping labels

This makes datasets consistent and professional.

🚫 NULL Handling and Preventing Errors

I handle missing or broken values using:

ISNULL() to replace NULL values with 0

COALESCE() to provide backup values

NULLIF() to prevent divide-by-zero crashes

These techniques are critical in real-world analytics.

🧮 Calculations and Data Conversion

I can perform numeric transformations such as:

CAST() to convert data types

Creating average paid price calculations safely

Converting decimals into integers when needed

This is important for financial and transaction datasets.

⏱️ Time Functions and Order Tracking

I work with date/time SQL tools including:

GETDATE() for current timestamps

DATEDIFF() to calculate how long ago an order happened

Useful for transaction history and business reports.

🔍 Checking Table Metadata and Column Types

I can inspect database structure using:

INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS

This helps verify column names, types, and schema correctness.

🔐 Transaction Control and Safety

I understand transaction handling for safe database updates:

BEGIN TRANSACTION

COMMIT to save changes

ROLLBACK to undo mistakes

This prevents accidental data loss in production systems.
